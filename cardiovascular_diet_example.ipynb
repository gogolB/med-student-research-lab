    "\n",
    "The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. It combines interviews and physical examinations to collect data on a wide range of health topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "NHANES is a major program of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), which is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The survey examines a nationally representative sample of about 5,000 people each year.\n",
